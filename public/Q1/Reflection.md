# **Reflection**
## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. Variable Decleration is like a place holder or a container for a specific value. You can use either let, const or var to declare what the value is equal to.
2. I got more knowledge with HTML and a bit of CSS(cause I already know how to use it) like how to style a button for example. I still need to practice writing HTML and CSS code. 
3. If else statments are really cool! They make it so that when your given expression is not true it will go to the else statement. That's why it's an if statement because its not always going to be equal to the if statement. If its not equal to the if statement then it would go to the else statement!
4. Javascript Operations: There many types of operations that arent just arithmatic. FOr example: comparisons, Logical and assignments, and in arithmatic operations there are special kinds of signs with like ===, ==, ++, -- and many more!
5. Markdown is like a HTML but instead of syntax you use symbols to create stuff. For example "#" for headers, " ** " **to make things bold**, and many more!

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.

1. I still need to practice loops because I still get confused when I should use the different types of loops. Sometimes I pick the harder version of the loop when trying to code something in javascript and I really need to practice it.
2. Arrays I understand it a bit but not fully. I don't really know when and why we need to use arrays but I know how to use them.
3. I understand functions but sometimes I still get lost when trying to them. Using functions is alright but I still make mistakes in trying to make functions.
4. The two parse things are a bit confusing because I really have no clue when I can use it. With a bit of practice I could probably understand it more.
5. I still make mistakes in logical operators. Its mostly because I either don't understand the statement or a careless mistake.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. For me I believe I need more pracitce because what I did was I just read and try to understand them in khub. I don't try to make a code using these things aside from the graded assignments. I should probably practice more to have a deeper understand with these topics or lessons.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

1. For me that all the activites were helpful and it helped me understand the topics more, but the activity were you have to find the errors in the code REALLY gave me a hard time and I was stuck on it for so long. But aside from that, the other activites were fun and it really helped!
